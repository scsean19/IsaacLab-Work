#IssacLab-Work

This folder is dedicated to a personal project of learning how to run NVIDIA IsaacLab trainings, how to gather data from these trainings, how to modify different models, and in general how this application works. 

I have added the Modified IsaacLab files that were used, the Jupyter notebook I used to pull in and analyze the data, and the data it's self from 1500 epoch training sessions. I also include a documentation of what I found through out this project.
