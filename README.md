#IssacLab-Work

This folder is dedicated to a personal project of learning how to run NVIDIA IsaacLab trainings, how to gather data from these trainings, how to modify different models, and in general how this application works. 

I have added the Modified IsaacLab files that were used, the Jupyter notebook I used to pull in and analyze the data, and the data it's self from 1500 epoch training sessions. I also include a documentation of what I found through out this project.

Skills Demonstrated:
- Reinforcement Learning (PPO algorithm)
- NVIDIA Isaac Sim/Lab
- Python scripting and debugging
- Reward function design and hyperparameter tuning
- Data analysis and visualization (TensorBoard, Jupyter)
- Windows environment troubleshooting
- Performance optimization analysis

  Training Configuration:
- Hardware: NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti
- Training Speed: ~38,000 FPS (4096 parallel environments)
- Training Time: ~45 minutes per 1500 epochs
- Framework: RL Games (PPO algorithm)
- Total Training Steps: ~2.7M per model
